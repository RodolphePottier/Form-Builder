# Rpottier Form

Custom Form Builder and Response Viewer
This project is a web application built with Next.js and Nest.js, designed to provide a user-friendly solution for creating customized forms. Users can effortlessly design their own forms to gather specific data, and the platform allows them to both respond to these forms and view responses. Additionally, the application provides the capability to modify existing forms, providing flexibility and control in data collection processes.

Key Features
- Form Creation: Build personalized forms tailored to your data collection needs. Customize form fields, types, and styles.

- Form Responses: Users can submit responses to the created forms, providing valuable data for analysis and decision-making.

- Response Viewer: Effortlessly review and analyze form responses in a structured manner, helping you make informed decisions.

- Form Editing: Modify and update existing forms to adapt to changing requirements or improvements.
